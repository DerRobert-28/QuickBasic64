This is a massively reduced version of "The Simplebuffer System" library
by RhoSigma. The full package with many more functions for bookmarking,
searching, copy'n'paste and EOL conversion, inclusive documentation and
examples is part of the author's "Libraries Collection" and can be found
for download at the respective forum thread here:

Note: The sb_qb64_extension.bi/.bm files are not part of the buffer system.
      These files provide glue code for use of the buffers inside qb64pe.
