The [[FREEFILE]] function returns a [[LONG]] value that is an unused file access number.


{{PageSyntax}}
: fileHandle& = [[FREEFILE]]


{{PageDescription}}
* [[FREEFILE]] values should be given to unique variables so that each file has a specific variable value assigned to it.
* Once the number is assigned in an [[OPEN]] statement, the file number can later be used to read, write or [[CLOSE]] that file.
* File numbers [[CLOSE]]d are made available to [[FREEFILE]] for reuse immediately.
* [[FREEFILE]] returns are normally sequential starting with 1. Only file numbers in use will not be returned.
* [[OPEN]] each file number after each [[FREEFILE]] return or the values returned may be the same.
